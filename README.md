> Where there are entries, there are types.

Generic types are designed to reduce the codes duplications.

- Where there are duplications, there are types;
- Where there are codes/comments, there are duplications;
- Where there are languages, there are duplications;
- Where there are graphics, there are duplications;

## Motivations

### Reducing Duplication

Tasks get handled in the simple( but duplicated) way, or in the generic( but complex) manner.

The same way, scripts and documents are written daily that are often(highly) duplicated.

Hence, commonly generic types are better to be defined and gathered together
to reduce the time-consuming duplications,
and in the way to empower people to get more complex tasks handled easily --
the way to share and reuse.

### Easier Maintenance

Maintenance means generics.

Generics ease maintenance.

That's the rules!

### Verbose Standards and Typed Implementations 

As the standards are often verbose and duplicated,
hence the implementations are responsible

- to get standards implemented elegantly
	- with reduced codes and operations;
	- with better user interactions;
- to take care of the rest;

There are demos like:

- [OpenAPI Specification - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification)
	- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
